# Excel Export Setup Guide

## Overview
This document explains how to set up and use the comprehensive Excel export functionality for the AdminRequests component.

## Installation ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Step 1: Install the xlsx library
The xlsx library has been successfully installed in the BOSFDR directory:

```bash
npm install xlsx --save
```

**Status**: ✅ Installed (version 0.18.5)

### ✅ Step 2: Import in your component
The import statement has been added to `AdminRequests.vue`:

```javascript
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';
```

**Status**: ✅ Import added to AdminRequests.vue

### Alternative: CDN Installation (Optional)
If you prefer to use the CDN version instead of npm, add this to your `public/index.html`:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/xlsx/0.18.5/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```

## Features

   - Cedula Details (Cedula-specific fields in organized sections)
   - Barangay Clearance Details (Barangay Clearance-specific fields in organized sections)

2. **Improved Readable Layout**:
   - **Vertical Key-Value Format**: Instead of 30+ columns, data is organized in readable sections
   - **Organized Information Blocks**: Request Info, Client Info, Beneficiary Info, Payment Info, etc.
   - **Document-Specific Sections**: Income, Property, Business, Tax info for Cedula; Legal Status, Voter Info, Emergency Contacts for Barangay Clearance

   - Authorized Pickup Person Data
   - Document-Specific Fields (income, property, business info for Cedula; legal status, emergency contacts for Barangay Clearance)
